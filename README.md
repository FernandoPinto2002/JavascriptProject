# Overview

As a software engineer, I am continuously working on strengthening my understanding of core programming concepts, especially in JavaScript. In this project, I built an Exercise Finder web application to deepen my understanding of data structures, recursion, ES6 array methods, and integration of third-party libraries. My goal was to move beyond simple DOM manipulation and demonstrate stronger problem-solving and logic design using JavaScript.

The Exercise Finder is a web-based application that allows users to select a muscle group or search for an exercise across a full database. The application dynamically displays exercises, including difficulty level, equipment needed, and practical training tips. The search functionality uses a fuzzy-search library to allow flexible matching of exercise names and related keywords.

The main purpose of this project was to practice working with nested data structures and recursive functions while improving my ability to write clean, structured JavaScript code. I also wanted to demonstrate the use of ES6 array methods such as filter, map, sort, and reduce, as well as show that I can integrate external tools like Fuse.js to enhance functionality.

# Development Environment

For this project, I used Visual Studio Code as my main development environment. I tested the application using Google Chrome and used the browser’s Developer Tools to debug and inspect elements. The project structure includes three main files: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for logic and functionality.

The programming language used in this project is JavaScript (ES6). I applied modern JavaScript features such as arrow functions, array methods (filter, map, sort, reduce), template literals, and recursion.

I also used Fuse.js, a lightweight JavaScript library loaded through a CDN, to implement fuzzy search functionality. This allowed users to search exercises across the entire dataset, even if the spelling was slightly off.

# Future Work

There are several improvements I would like to implement in the future:

- Add an equipment filter to allow filtering by bodyweight, barbell, dumbbell, etc.
- Implement a “Favorites” feature using localStorage to save selected exercises.
- Improve UI responsiveness and mobile layout.

- Add a workout builder where users can create and save routines.

# AI Disclosure

- I used AI to understand better the use of fuse and how to use to so I could implement it on my project.

- I also used AI to create more exercises for each muscle group since typing each one of them would be a task that can be fastly done using the help of AI. So the app can show its potential.
